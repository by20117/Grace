  <p class="introbio">In my 7th grade year at Thornton Junior High School, I passed the Science Olympiad entry test and was placed
  on the Thornton Blue Team. From there on, I participated in the Regionals and was reaccepted onto the Thornton
  Blue Team the following year.</p>

    <p class="resultsintro"> Here are my results from Science Olympiad. Each person's individual scores count towards the final score of the team. The lower
    the number, the better it is for the team. That means that if someone got a very bad place, like 30, it would drag the entire team
    down, which shows how much of Science Olympiad is based on teamwork.</p>

  <h2 class="semititle">7th Grade Results</h2>
  <p class="sevieres">During 7th grade, it was my first time taking part in Science Olympiad. At the Regionals, I actually did better than most of my team.
  I received 3 medals: 4th place for Mystery Architecture, 4th place for Fossils, and 6th place for Heredity. My team, Yellow team, finished
overall in 3rd place. The top 3 teams get to advance to state, but luck was not on our side. The Thornton Blue Team managed to get first that year
and only one team from each school is allowed to advance, so naturally, my team was disqualified and another school got to go. </p>

  <h2 class="semititle">8th Grade Results</h2>
  <p class="eightyres">During my 8th grade year at Thornton, for my previous achievements on the Thornton Yellow Team, I was one of the people picked to join the
  blue team. The blue team is supposed to be Thornton's best team, so we had a lot of great expectations. At the Regionals, I received only 2 medals: 3rd place for Ornithology,
3rd place for Fossils, and 8th place for EL Glider. My team was given a very nice surprise when we were announced the first place winners of the Regionals. We were very excited
for States. However, tragedy struck as both States and Nationals were cancelled because of the coronavirus.</p>
