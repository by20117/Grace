      <h2 class="old">Overview:</h2><br><br><br>
      <p class="old">One of my 7th grade subjects was Fossils. Fossils is the study of the remains of once alive organisms.
      My partner was an 8th grader named Agastya. We were given a Science Olympiad Official Fossil List. The fossil
    list changes a bit each year to provide new information.</p>

<h2 class="introrules">Rules:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Each team gets to have a 2-inch ring binder that contains all of their research. The supervisors are very serious
  about this. They sometimes check each binder and if a binder is bigger than it is allowed to be, the team will be disqualified or forced
  to use only their memories. The binder's contents can be anything regarding the event.</li>
  <li>During the test, there will be stations laid out on different tables. You can only visit each station once. Each station will be timed
  between 1-4 minutes. If you do not finish, you still have to move on. You are not allowed to go back to any past stations.</li>
  <li>You may not take out any pages from your binder during the test. Everything you look at has to be firmly attached to the binder.</li>
</ul>
